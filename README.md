### Custom Domain

In order to use a domain it must first be configured in the repository settings. Then a `CNAME` file should be created in the root directory ([example](https://github.com/syntax-tm/gundwn.gg/blob/main/CNAME)). You can read more about adding custom domains for GitHub Pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
